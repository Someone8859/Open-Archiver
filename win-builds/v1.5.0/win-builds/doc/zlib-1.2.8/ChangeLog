  is lost when library is used--resolution is to build new zconf.h
- Documentation improvements (in zlib.h):
    - Document raw deflate and inflate
    - Update RFCs URL
    - Point out that zlib and gzip formats are different
    - Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal
    - Document string limit for gzprintf() and possible buffer overflow
    - Note requirement on avail_out when flushing
    - Note permitted values of flush parameter of inflate()
- Add some FAQs (and even answers) to the FAQ
- Add contrib/inflate86/ for x86 faster inflate
- Add contrib/blast/ for PKWare Data Compression Library decompression
- Add contrib/puff/ simple inflate for deflate format description

Changes in 1.1.4 (11 March 2002)
- ZFREE was repeated on same allocation on some error conditions.
  This creates a security problem described in
  http://www.zlib.org/advisory-2002-03-11.txt
- Returned incorrect error (Z_MEM_ERROR) on some invalid data
- Avoid accesses before window for invalid distances with inflate window
