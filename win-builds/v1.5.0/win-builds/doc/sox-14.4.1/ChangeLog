sox-12.18.2	2006-09-03
-----------

  o Adding in Debian's disk full fix (#313206).
  o Finally got rid of reference to cleanup() function in
    library.  Applications are now required to detect
    all failures from return codes and cleanup as they
    want.
  o Changed how list of formats and effects are stored internally.
    Effects libst users only. Dirk
  o Store effects usage so that its accessable by applications.
    Dirk
  o Modify the synth effect to not use SIGINT to stop processing
    and instead return ST_EOF.  This allows exact acount of
    samples to be written out instead of an approximate amount.
  o Fix hangup when attempting to write stereo MP3 files.
    (1512218) Kendrick Shaw
  o Fix deemph effect would lose stereo separation. (1479249)  robs
  o Adding cross-platform support for getopt_long
  o Make help screens print much more information and add
    new --help-effect option.  (Originally from Dirk).
  o Add support for using an external gsm library instead of
    just the internal one.  Vladimir Nadvornik
  o Updates to nul file handler to prevent crashes during output.
    Martin Panter (1482869)


sox-12.18.1	2006-05-07
------------

  o The "filter" effect could go into infinite drain mode.  Now
    only drain 1 buffer.  noisered as well.
  o SoX was ignoring user aborts (ctrl-c) if it occured during
    effect drain operations.  This was bad if effects had
    bugs and stuck in infinite loop.
  o Stop SoX from crashing when file type could not be auto
    determined (1417776).
  o Output filenames with multiple '.' confused SoX.  (1417776)
    Christian Hammer
  o Moved to a common set of CLIP routines.  This fixed clipping
    bugs in noisered and mcompand.
  o Stop SoX from crashing on sphere files that contain large text
    strings.  (1430025) Ulf Hamhammar
  o Fix some overflow crashes in aiff handler. (1430024)  Ulf Hamhammar.
  o Under windows, set piped input/output to binary mode (1417794). Martin
    Panter
  o Fixed broken internal version of strdup().  (1417790) Marty
  o Stop infinite loop when reading MP3's with a tag size of
    exactly 8192 bytes.  (1417511) Hans Fugal
  o Fix typo in stlib.dsp for loading in Visual Studio 6.
  o Fixed problems in silence effect related to removing multiple
    periods of silence from the middle of the sound file.
  o Reduced the window size greatly on the silence effect to
    prevent leaving in silence that looked like noise still based
    on RMS values.
  o Prevent infinite loop in pitch effect from uninitialize variable.
    Frank Heckenbach
  o Prevent crashes when printing error mesages (1447239)
  o Added makefile and support files to compile using Open Watcom
    compiler.  (1417798) Marty
  o Stop calling flow() on effects that returned EOF during drain().  Allows
    two back-to-back reverse effects to work.
  o Added support for multiple channels in .dat files.
    (1366634) tomchristie


sox-12.17.9	2005-12-05
-----------

  o Updates to compile under VC6. Jimen Ching
  o Declare st_signalinfo_t to specifically be signed in case
    platform does not default ot signed chars.  This
    is required for NetBSD/powerpc.
  o When seek()ing in AIFF, SMP, and WAV handlers, remaining samples were
    incorrectly computed based on bytes and not samples.  Jukka
  o Changed noisered effect to just warn during clipping instead
    of aborting.  Ian Turner
  o Fixed bug were pieces of audio were lost every buffer read
    when running both -c and -r options together on mono audio.
    Users probably percieved it as shorter audio files that
    played with a sped up tempo.
    Bugfix will also apply to other times when multiple effects
    are ran on the command line.
  o Added support for -V option to play/rec scripts.
  o Fix to silence effect to allow negative periods to be specified
    (to remove silence from middle of sound file).
  o Fix swap option handling so that special case of "swap 1 1" will
    work.
  o Track length of Ogg Vorbis files on read.
  o Add support for displaying a status line that tracks progress
    of read/write routines.  Part of information requires read
    file handlers to be able to determine file length.
  o Converted alsa driver to use asoundlib instead of directly
    talking to kernel driver.  This also means that device names
    are now the ALSA logical names instead of /dev type names.
  o Added ALSA support to play/rec scripts.
  o Added st_open*, st_read, st_write, st_seek, st_close routines
    to help simplify developer interface to libst.  See libst.3..
  o Removed st_initformat(), st_copyformat(), and
    st_checkformat() from library.  If your app used those
    functions then copy them from 12.17.8 source code
    directly into your application or update to use new
    routines.
  o Force word-alignment on AIFF SSND and APPL chunks on input.
    Matthew Hodgson.
  o Add fix to WAV handler to only return data in multiples
    of sample_size*channels to better handle corrupt files.
  o Fixed bug where "-4" option didn't work with avg
    effect (Tom Christie).
  o Fixed fade's fade-out-length to match man page
    description as noted by Geoff Kuenning.  This required
    updates to the sample crossfade scripts.  Also modified fade
    effect to report when no more samples will be produced to
    prevent unneeded reading of whole file.
