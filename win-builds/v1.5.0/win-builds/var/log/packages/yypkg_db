D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as \"new hardware device added\" or \"printer queue changed\") and a per user login session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly (without going through the message bus daemon).

GDB can do four main kinds of things to help you catch bugs in the act:   1) Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.  2) Make your program stop on specified conditions.  3) Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.  4) Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
