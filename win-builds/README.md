# About win-builds

Win-builds is a project that provide binary UNIX-like packages for running on Windows hosts.

From the Win-builds website: Win-builds is a large distribution of binary packages for Windows. All of them are built from source. Win-builds provides a package manager and runs on Windows, MSYS, Cygwin and Linux. It is entirely free software.

The latest version of win-builds is 1.5.0 released in 2015. We do not recommend you to install Win-builds now because their packages can be out-of-date, you may install MSYS2 or Cygwin either.

# Win-builds is stopped

In the 2021 December, I've checked out win-builds (I usually install it instead of MSYS2 because msys2 come with unnecessary packages (because I'm dumb that time). ) and then I see that the project has stopped, in their website. The website is still keeping, however, for references only.

This GitHub repo is keeping for people who still wants to install Win-builds on Windows, or testing, or debugging purpose. All of them are entirely free software without warranty.
